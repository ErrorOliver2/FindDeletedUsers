# FindDeletedUsers
Vencord plugin to find deleted users. DM @ErrorOliver on Discord to submit users to add.<br>
Requires proof, preferably what the user said, for example: a YouTube channel link of their own, etc. Post something unlisted on it and give me it then done. <i>There are other ways to provide proof too.</i>

> [!WARNING]  
> This hasn't been worked on for a while.<br>
> I am busy with other projects, maybe one day this plugin will release?
